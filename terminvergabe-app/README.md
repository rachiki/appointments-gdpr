## Ideas for improvement
1. Simple login for employees (single pw is enough)
2. Remove all personal data fields, instead do registration with any string (a secret_id)
2.1 See your appointments when entering your secret_id, delete appointments there
3 Block limited number of appointments for a timeslot
4. Set the default number of timeslots for each weekday and slot 
5. Translate to german

# Purpose
This is a repo for scheduling appointments in a very simple way, that should not be affected by any GDPR requirements as the only info needed for booking is any string and a timeslot (no guarantees here!).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
